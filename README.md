# UTOR-VIRT-FSF-PT-02-2023-U-LOLC

Each week, this repo will be updated on Thursday with:

- the course materials for the next week
- and, the activity solutions for the current week.

## Folder Structure

Each module's folder has:

- `01-Activities`: Base templates and supporting materials for in-class activities. The `solved` folders will be pushed after Thursday's classes.
- `02-Challenge`: Starter code (if provided) and instructions for weekly modules. In addition to Canvas lessons.

This repo will be used read-only. Only the instructional team can update. Please do not push any commit/branch here.

Don't forget to `git pull` latest updates before the classes on Monday.

Happy coding!
